Defcon
======
Defcon is a set of UFO based objects optimized for use in font editing applications. The objects are built to be lightweight, fast and flexible. The objects are very bare-bones and they are not meant to be end-all, be-all objects. Rather, they are meant to provide base functionality so that you can focus on your applicationâ€™s behavior, not object observing or maintaining cached data. Defcon implements UFO3 as described by the [UFO font format](http://unifiedfontobject.org). If needed, the [ufo2-deprecated](https://github.com/typesupply/defcon/tree/ufo2-deprecated) branch has the older, UFO2, version of Defcon.
